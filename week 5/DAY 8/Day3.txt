Types of selectiors in CSS:

Simple selectors - selecting by id, name, class
Combinator selectors - selecting based on the relationship between them
pseudo-class selectors - selecting elements based on  certain state
pseudo-elements selectors - selectingand styling certain part of element
attribute selectors - selecting elements basing on attribute value

Eg:

p{};
#id{};
.class{};
p.class{};
<p = "class1 class2">{};
*{};
h1,h2,p{};

"this" - DOM object whereas $(this) - equivalent but in terms of jQuery.
The difference is that in "this" we can use DOM methods but cant involve jQuery methods, 
whereas in $(this), we can call jQuery methods but not DOM methods.

In order to manipulate the page, the document need to be ready. The line $(document).ready() in jQuery 
checks this readiness of document object model(DOM) and the code inside will run once
the DOM is ready.

The on() method attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements.


$("p").on("click", function(){
  $(this).hide();
});

$('input[type=text], textarea').css({width: '90%'});
That uses standard CSS selectors, jQuery also has a set of pseudo-selector filters for various form elements, for example:

$(':text').css({width: '90%'});
will match all <input type="text"> elements.
